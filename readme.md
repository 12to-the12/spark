# spark
this repository contains my system configuration information as well as resources in order to easily find what I'm looking for
I would use Obsidian, but all of the files here are meant to be executable as well
## usage
the makefile will assemble the contents of the scripts in the src directory into a single file, then upload that file to a remote fileserver, and then create a docker image to test it on different platforms
