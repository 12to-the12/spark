#!/home/logan/.local/bin/mdsh
# Hello World in Python

The following code block is executed at compile time (due to the `@mdsh`).
(The first word on the opening line could be `shell` or `sh` or anything
else, as long as the second word is `@mdsh`.)

```bash @mdsh
mdsh-lang-python() { python; }
```

Now that we've defined a language handler for `python`, this next code
block is translated to shell code that runs python with the block's
contents on stdin:

```python
print("hello world!")
```

#!/usr/bin/env mdsh
